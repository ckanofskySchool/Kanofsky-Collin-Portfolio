Specifically, we focused on how changes are stored in Git and the ability to create branches of the repo for development without affecting the original branch. 9/17/2025 Today, we practiced with Git and created shared Repo's with eachother to practice with collaborator settings on github. 9/24/2025 Today, I decided to order the essential electronics for my project, this included the motor controllers, the batteries, and the safety mechanisms. 9/25/2025 Today, we did a soldering activity where we practiced surface mount and through hole soldering using a halloween owl kit which lights up when you touch it. The surface mount soldering, internal components, and the finished product are shown in pictures below. 9/26/2025 Outside of class today, I used the AI Claude with the Opus4.1 model to generate some starting code for my project. The programs I had made were a RP2040 Seeed program which will control the motors, and a RaspberryPi + AI Camera program which will hand the tracking aspects and math of the camera. I am using the AI formulated code as a launchpad in order to be more efficient and spend more time on customization and troubleshooting, than have to spend that time on writing the base code myself. However, to ensure I understood the code and would be able to edit and modify it, I made sure to go through each line and ensure that I understood why and what the line did, and how modifing that line of code would impact the overall preformance of the program. The initial prompts I inputed are shown below. Prompt for RP2040 Seeed Code write me an arduino code for a RP2040 Seeed which will take input from the usb serial coming off a raspberry pi and move 2 drive motors on my robot using pwm(like how servos are controlled) according to the directions. For input directions, there should be a heading which if is outside the middle range set by me in a variable, then the program should turn until the the heading is once again within acceptable values. Another input will be the distance from the target which also should be kept within acceptable range set by me in a variable. Lastly, have a serial monitor where I can input values for left motor and right motors to test if I want. One last thing is whenever motor powers are set, send back what has been set across the usb serial for the Pi to recieve. Prompt for Raspberry Pi Code can you now right me a raspberry pi program in pythong prob. that will provide these inputs needed based off a raspberry pi 5 and a raspberry pi AI camera attachment. Also have the raspberry pi host a webserver that allows the user to see the motor power assignements and camera feed. there should be a simple but neat UI for that web page pls","title":"Daily Journal"},{"location":"DailyJournal/#9162025","text":"Today, we learned about Git, Github, Github desktop, and the browser github as well.

Basic Build Goals Build a Modular Mounting Frame that will allow customizability and adaptabiltity Build a gearbox that can be mounted on frame to drive wheels Be able to hold a backpack Be able to drive around Not too pricey Robust and Durable even in bad weather conditions Look Amazing! Basic Programming/Hardware Goals Modular Programming setup as well for future project use and easy transport of code testing materials Track and follow a human in front of the robot Assign powers to the wheels according to the tracking data and make the robot follow the user Clean and Organized Code! Advanced Goals Instead of following a user, the robot understands it's surroundings and can navigate itself to a selected location Selected location can be chosen through voice commands Robot can detect obstacles and chose to avoid or simply stop and wait. Robot can connect to a server where robot data on location, travel, speed, battery, etc. can be accesed and this could potentially lead to mutliple RoboPack units collaborating. Design Specification Considerations What do you want your project to do? a backpack carrying robot I have named the \"Robopack\". This robot will carry around your backpack for you and will give me a starting point for future more intricate and advanced projects. Is the project for you or someone else? For me initially, but potentially adverstisable to the school as autonomous helper units. If someone else, have you talked to them about design specs? I have talked a bit to an electrician I know about the electronics of the project Are you considering a group project? What is your part Not really, but if someone wanted to join me and add on to the project, I would be open to collaborators. Will your project be inside or outside? Mostly outside but a bit of both. Will your project be portable? Yes, the robot needs to be somewhat portable Will your project connect to the Internet? Yes, it will interact with image vision proccesing and speak to a main base computer Will your project use Bluetooth? Probably not but it could if I connect phone integration. Does your project use a vinyl cutter? Yes, for branding and warning stickers. Does your project use a laser cutter? Yes, for initial gearbox prototypes Does your project use a 3D printer? Yes, for the wheels and additional complex 3Dparts Does your project use a large CNC machine (Shopbot)? Yes for the expensive wood cutting, but also the small for cutting aluminium for the final gearbox plates Does your project have intelligence (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, computer)? Yes, a raspberry pi for computing the vision proccesing and communicating back to a home base computer What are your project inputs? Camera, Microphone, Switches like breakers and safeties. What are your project outputs? Motors, Speaker How does your project differ from the project that inspired you? The project that inspired me was the starships but my project will hold backpacks instead of food and provide a base for many more applications in the future rather than limiting the functionality to one aspect. When was the inspirational project built? July 3rd, 2014 was when starships took off. Do you have a tutorial or instructions for your project? No, I will be taking on the challenge from scratch. How current is the tutorial? Does not exist currently. What is the maximum that you want to spend? No more than $75.00 $450, but I will be paying out of pocket as this is a passion project for me. What are the dimensions of your project? 24\"x20\"x15\" Frame and then some bottom ~6\" for the motor + wheels What materials will you use? 80/20 Framing, CIM Motors, Raspberry Pi, and more that are undetermined as of now. Have you completed the spreadsheet? No? I have a rough BOM spreadsheet currently. Are the parts for your project still available? Yes, I have a lot of them accesable to me for free or already have them Are the tools you need for the project found in the FabLab? Some yes, and some are found in my robotics location. How will you conceal the electronics? Using a removable pannel on the bottom of the robot.","title":"Project Overview"},{"location":"ProjectOverview/#goals","text":"I have been working on the brainstorming and planning for this project for over half a year, and these are the realistic goals I have set for myself in order to consider this porject a success.","title":"Goals"},{"location":"ProjectOverview/#basic-build-goals","text":"Build a Modular Mounting Frame that will allow customizability and adaptabiltity Build a gearbox that can be mounted on frame to drive wheels Be able to hold a backpack Be able to drive around Not too pricey Robust and Durable even in bad weather conditions Look Amazing!","title":"Basic Build Goals"},{"location":"ProjectOverview/#basic-programminghardware-goals","text":"Modular Programming setup as well for future project use and easy transport of code testing materials Track and follow a human in front of the robot Assign powers to the wheels according to the tracking data and make the robot follow the user Clean and Organized Code!","title":"Basic Programming/Hardware Goals"},{"location":"ProjectOverview/#advanced-goals","text":"Instead of following a user, the robot understands it's surroundings and can navigate itself to a selected location Selected location can be chosen through voice commands Robot can detect obstacles and chose to avoid or simply stop and wait.

From my previous robotics experience, I have learned that modularity and the ability to re-use and adjust is essential. To ensure optimal flexability, I chose to use 80/20 tubing, specifically the 1530 & 1515 series tubing shown below for robust structure, flexible attachment points, and premade strong brackets that can be re-used and moved. 1530 Tubing 15Series Bracket Style Planning After getting all the functionality down, I plan to use a nice wood to give a natural style to the robot. Another idea I have is to get plastic parts that can cover the machine as well, but that might be more complicated and expensive. Hardware Planning Motors & Motor Controller I am planning to use CIM motors which I've learned from my robotics teams, the reason for using a CIM motor is due to low costs sitting at around 17$, and the output it produces being 5,330 RPM, with 21.33 in/lbs of torque which is pretty powerfull and should definatly ensure a job well done.
