Throughout my childhood, I have built numberous robots and machines through my super fun robotics teams and the intense but greatly benificial Fab Academy program. However, as I approached my senior year capstone project, I decided that I wanted to take my knowledge from robotics, and apply it with the skills from Fab Academy to make a modular Chassis that can host many projects to come. However, before I get ahead of myself, I am starting off with the goal of a backpack carrying robot I have named the \"Robopack\". This robot will carry around your backpack for you and will give me a starting point for future more intricate and advanced projects.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Hi, my name is collin kanofsky and I am a senior at Charlotte Latin School looking ot major in mechatronics.

Basic Build Goals Build a Modular Mounting Frame that will allow customizability and adaptabiltity Build a gearbox that can be mounted on frame to drive wheels Be able to hold a backpack Be able to drive around Not too pricey Robust and Durable even in bad weather conditions Look Amazing! Basic Programming/Hardware Goals Modular Programming setup as well for future project use and easy transport of code testing materials Track and follow a human in front of the robot Assign powers to the wheels according to the tracking data and make the robot follow the user Clean and Organized Code! Advanced Goals Instead of following a user, the robot understands it's surroundings and can navigate itself to a selected location Selected location can be chosen through voice commands Robot can detect obstacles and chose to avoid or simply stop and wait. Robot can connect to a server where robot data on location, travel, speed, battery, etc. can be accesed and this could potentially lead to mutliple RoboPack units collaborating.","title":"Project Overview"},{"location":"ProjectOverview/#goals","text":"I have been working on the brainstorming and planning for this project for over half a year, and these are the realistic goals I have set for myself in order to consider this porject a success.","title":"Goals"},{"location":"ProjectOverview/#basic-build-goals","text":"Build a Modular Mounting Frame that will allow customizability and adaptabiltity Build a gearbox that can be mounted on frame to drive wheels Be able to hold a backpack Be able to drive around Not too pricey Robust and Durable even in bad weather conditions Look Amazing!","title":"Basic Build Goals"},{"location":"ProjectOverview/#basic-programminghardware-goals","text":"Modular Programming setup as well for future project use and easy transport of code testing materials Track and follow a human in front of the robot Assign powers to the wheels according to the tracking data and make the robot follow the user Clean and Organized Code!","title":"Basic Programming/Hardware Goals"},{"location":"ProjectOverview/#advanced-goals","text":"Instead of following a user, the robot understands it's surroundings and can navigate itself to a selected location Selected location can be chosen through voice commands Robot can detect obstacles and chose to avoid or simply stop and wait.

From my previous robotics experience, I have learned that modularity and the ability to re-use and adjust is essential. To ensure optimal flexability, I chose to use 80/20 tubing, specifically the 1530 & 1515 series tubing shown below for robust structure, flexible attachment points, and premade strong brackets that can be re-used and moved. 1530 Tubing 15Series Bracket Style Planning After getting all the functionality down, I plan to use a nice wood to give a natural style to the robot. Another idea I have is to get plastic parts that can cover the machine as well, but that might be more complicated and expensive. Hardware Planning Motors & Motor Controller I am planning to use CIM motors which I've learned from my robotics teams, the reason for using a CIM motor is due to low costs sitting at around 17$, and the output it produces being 5,330 RPM, with 21.33 in/lbs of torque which is pretty powerfull and should definatly ensure a job well done.
