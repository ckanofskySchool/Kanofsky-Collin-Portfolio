## Mechanical Systems

I started my CAD journey a while back in sophmore year as I was super exited for this project, but I will do my best to re-track my steps to show how the CAD came to be.

I started off my design by drawing out what I wanted the robot to look like, what parts I could use, etc. At the start, I was thinking about using 2x4 wooden board due to them being cheep, accesible, and sturdy. However, I decided to use 80/20 due to it's modularity and robustness



### Programming Systems

I started off the coding of the Raspberry Pi Brain by installing the Raspberry Pi AI Camera and followed the instructions from the [Raspberry Pi AI Camera Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/ai-camera.html). After setting up the IMX 500 Library, I ran the example object dection code with the following terminal command:
~~~ rpicam-hello -t 0s --post-process-file /usr/share/rpi-camera-assets/imx500_mobilenet_ssd.json --viewfinder-width 1920 --viewfinder-height 1080 --framerate 30 ~~~
