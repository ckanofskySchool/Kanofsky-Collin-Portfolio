title: Project Overview

## Goals

I have been working on the brainstorming and planning for this project for over half a year, and these are the realistic goals I have set for myself in order to consider this porject a success.

### Basic Build Goals
- Build a Modular Mounting Frame that will allow customizability and adaptabiltity
- Build a gearbox that can be mounted on frame to drive wheels
- Be able to hold a backpack
- Be able to drive around
- Not too pricey
- Robust and Durable even in bad weather conditions
- Look Amazing!

### Basic Programming/Hardware Goals
- Modular Programming setup as well for future project use and easy transport of code testing materials
- Track and follow a human in front of the robot
- Assign powers to the wheels according to the tracking data and make the robot follow the user
- Clean and Organized Code!

### Advanced Goals
- Instead of following a user, the robot understands it's surroundings and can navigate itself to a selected location
- Selected location can be chosen through voice commands
- Robot can detect obstacles and chose to avoid or simply stop and wait.
- Robot can connect to a server where robot data on location, travel, speed, battery, etc. can be accesed and this could potentially lead to mutliple RoboPack units collaborating.

## Design Specification Considerations

1. What do you want your project to do?

    a backpack carrying robot I have named the "Robopack". This robot will carry around your backpack for you and will give me a starting point for future more intricate and advanced projects.

2. Is the project for you or someone else?

    For me initially, but potentially adverstisable to the school as autonomous helper units.

3. If someone else, have you talked to them about design specs?

    I have talked a bit to an electrician I know about the electronics of the project

4. Are you considering a group project? What is your part

    Not really, but if someone wanted to join me and add on to the project, I would be open to collaborators.

5. Will your project be inside or outside?

    Mostly outside but a bit of both.

6. Will your project be portable?

    Yes, the robot needs to be somewhat portable

7. Will your project connect to the Internet?

    Yes, it will interact with image vision proccesing and speak to a main base computer

8. Will your project use Bluetooth?

    Probably not but it could if I connect phone integration.

9. Does your project use a vinyl cutter?

    Yes, for branding and warning stickers.

10. Does your project use a laser cutter?

    Yes, for initial gearbox prototypes

11. Does your project use a 3D printer?

    Yes, for the wheels and additional complex 3Dparts

12. Does your project use a large CNC machine (Shopbot)?

    Yes for the expensive wood cutting, but also the small for cutting aluminium for the final gearbox plates

13. Does your project have intelligence (Arduino, Raspberry Pi,
computer)?

    Yes, a raspberry pi for computing the vision proccesing and communicating back to a home base computer

14. What are your project inputs?

    Camera, Microphone, Switches like breakers and safeties.

15. What are your project outputs?

    Motors, Speaker

16. How does your project differ from the project that inspired you?

    The project that inspired me was the [starships](https://www.starship.xyz/) but my project will hold backpacks instead of food and provide a base for many more applications in the future rather than limiting the functionality to one aspect.

17. When was the inspirational project built?

    July 3rd, 2014 was when [starships](https://www.starship.xyz/) took off.

18. Do you have a tutorial or instructions for your project?

    No, I will be taking on the challenge from scratch.

19. How current is the tutorial?

    Does not exist currently.

20. What is the maximum that you want to spend? No more than
$75.00

    $450, but I will be paying out of pocket as this is a passion project for me.

21. What are the dimensions of your project?

    24"x20"x15" Frame and then some bottom ~6" for the motor + wheels

22. What materials will you use?

    80/20 Framing, CIM Motors, Raspberry Pi, and more that are undetermined as of now.

23. Have you completed the spreadsheet?

    No? I have a rough BOM spreadsheet currently.

24. Are the parts for your project still available?

    Yes, I have a lot of them accesable to me for free or already have them

25. Are the tools you need for the project found in the FabLab?

    Some yes, and some are found in my robotics location.

26. How will you conceal the electronics?

    Using a removable pannel on the bottom of the robot.
