title: Project Overview

## Goals

I have been working on the brainstorming and planning for this project for over half a year, and these are the realistic goals I have set for myself in order to consider this porject a success.

### Basic Build Goals
- Build a Modular Mounting Frame that will allow customizability and adaptabiltity
- Build a gearbox that can be mounted on frame to drive wheels
- Be able to hold a backpack
- Be able to drive around
- Not too pricey
- Robust and Durable even in bad weather conditions
- Look Amazing!

### Basic Programming/Hardware Goals
- Modular Programming setup as well for future project use and easy transport of code testing materials
- Track and follow a human in front of the robot
- Assign powers to the wheels according to the tracking data and make the robot follow the user
- Clean and Organized Code!

### Advanced Goals
- Instead of following a user, the robot understands it's surroundings and can navigate itself to a selected location
- Selected location can be chosen through voice commands
- Robot can detect obstacles and chose to avoid or simply stop and wait.
- Robot can connect to a server where robot data on location, travel, speed, battery, etc. can be accesed and this could potentially lead to mutliple RoboPack units collaborating.
